This website serves as an online portfolio to showcase my web prescence and projects to potential employers. 
The frontend is built using React.js.
The backend is maintained by Sanity.io.
Sanity.io is a platform for structured content that comes with an open-source editing environment called Sanity Studio that you can customize with JavaScript, and a real-time hosted data store.
